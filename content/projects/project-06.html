<p>The GrOW Research Series brings together scholarly research on women’s economic empowerment and economic growth in low-income countries. It is housed at the Institute for the Study of International Development at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.</p>

<p>Through the dissemination of working papers, policy briefs and other original scholarship, the GrOW Research Series serves as an online, open access platform to showcase current research with a view to promoting evidence-based policy-making. It is also the official, though not exclusive, research platform for the Growth and Economic Opportunities for Women (GrOW) program, a multi-funder partnership between the UK Government's Department for International Development, The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, and Canada’s International Development Research Centre.</p>
