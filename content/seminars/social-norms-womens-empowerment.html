	<h2>Description:</h2>

	<p>This seminar/webinar will explore the role that social norms play in dictating women's choices, access to jobs, and in the impact of policies and programs intended to encourage women's labour force participation. While women and girls' access to education and healthcare has been consistently improving over time, this has not translated into gains in the labour market. Women remain stuck in low quality, informal work, responsible for the vast majority of unpaid work and care responsibilities, and even policies and programs specifically designed to promote gender equality often come up short in results.</p>

	<p>Norms are context specific, difficult to identify, and difficult to measure, and yet they have significant impacts on women's lives. All of the speakers will discuss research the role of norms in their experience as researchers and practitioners working on women's economic empowerment in low-income countries, and that way those norms shaped not only the lives of women but their own work.</p>
