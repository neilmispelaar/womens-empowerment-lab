	<h2>Description:</h2>

	<p>This seminar/webinar will share information on quantitative methodologies for conducting research on women's empowerment, with a focus on rigorous and experimental methodologies like randomized control trials. Some key considerations will include: causal inference and counterfactual analysis, non-technical overview of main techniques to assess causal impacts, discussion around when certain techniques are appropriate, budget, sample size, cultural context, building equal and effective partnerships, and developing robust empowerment indexes, variables and indicators that meet the research question. Information on state of the art tools for conducting quantitative research, data collection and gender analysis will also be shared.</p>
