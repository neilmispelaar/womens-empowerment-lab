<p>This 2-hour webinar will discuss state of the art research on measurement of women’s economic empowerment. A diverse panel of experts from the worlds of research, policy and practice will discuss contemporary challenges, opportunities and approaches for measuring this complex concept.</p>

<p>This is the first in a series of seven research-to-practice training seminars on women’s empowerment organized by the WED Lab in partnership with Canada’s International Development Research Centre.</p>

	<h2>Description:</h2>

	<p>The debate on measuring <abbr>WEE</abbr> is evolving rapidly. With conceptual foundations in Kabeer (2002), pioneer instruments around women’s autonomy and decision making (such as those utilized in the Demographic and Health Surveys) and IFPRI’s Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) are now increasingly seeing competing and complementary instruments to reflect a better understanding of the concept itself and practitioners’ needs for impact evaluation. Yet current tensions exist between practitioners’ need for conformity across metrics and the reality of context and cultural specific representation of <abbr>WEE</abbr>.</p>
